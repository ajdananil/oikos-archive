With a highschool friend we cought 10 vats from a tropical park. they lived at home with us for 1.5 month, locked in a bedroom where we also some times slept. watching them all day long to undersatnd how the guide them selves through the space, using a vabrational sound, which bounced back to them announcing them what is in front of them to avoice crashing on things. We put different thikness of streads around the room to experiement with them… WE fed them with fruits. They survived this captive room longer than any previous scientist experiements done before, with a record of 2 weeks, while we record 1.5 month before they died.
