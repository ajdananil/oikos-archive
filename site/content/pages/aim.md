Through these unforeseen gestures of tuning in with the existing world, and its multiple forms of representation, we hope to find a way of reconnecting to it, emotionally, creatively and personally, a cross time, space, and culture, practicing our belonging to one and the same planet.
Thank you for contributing to this non profit platform of world interconnectivity, challenging how language is used to communicate the world we inhabit.
