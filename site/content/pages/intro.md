As a child I used to love to listen to the buzzing of thousands of cicadas. But after a short time - I can't say whether days or weeks - they would all fall silent, because they were stuck in the trees, desiccated. I would grap a dry, empty transparent shell, as if they would flee and leave their skin there, or dry to death from singing? The latter seemed so powerful to me, to sing until they were stuffed into a tree, what a beautiful immolation. To make nature happy with their song and soon after to die of singing.
